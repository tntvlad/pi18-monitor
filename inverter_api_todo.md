# 📋 Inverter API Organization Todo List

## 🎯 Phase 1: Planning & Design (Week 1)

### Define API Requirements
- [ ] List all inverter functions that need API endpoints
- [ ] Identify read-only vs. action endpoints
- [ ] Document expected data formats for each endpoint
- [ ] Define user roles and permissions needed

### Design API Structure
- [ ] Create API endpoint hierarchy diagram
- [ ] Define resource names following REST conventions
- [ ] Plan URL structure with versioning (/api/v1/)
- [ ] Document HTTP methods for each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Create API Documentation Template
- [ ] Set up OpenAPI/Swagger specification file
- [ ] Define request/response schemas
- [ ] Document error codes and messages
- [ ] Create example requests and responses

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Refactoring Current API (Week 2)

### Restructure Endpoints
- [ ] Rename /api/data to /api/v1/inverter/data ✓
- [ ] Convert /api/command/<cmd> to /api/v1/inverter/commands/{command}
- [ ] Move /api/set_time to /api/v1/inverter/settings/time
- [ ] Create additional logical groupings (status, alarms, settings)

### Implement HTTP Methods Properly
- [ ] Use GET for all read operations
- [ ] Use POST for commands and actions
- [ ] Use PUT for updating settings ✓
- [ ] Use DELETE where applicable

### Standardize Response Formats
- [ ] Create consistent JSON response structure
- [ ] Include timestamps in all responses
- [ ] Add metadata (version, request_id)
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes

## 🔒 Phase 3: Security & Authentication (Week 3)

### Implement Authentication
- [ ] Choose authentication method (API Key, JWT, OAuth2)
- [ ] Create authentication middleware
- [ ] Set up user/device registration system
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism

### Add Security Measures
- [ ] Implement HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Add rate limiting per endpoint
- [ ] Set up CORS policies
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization

## 📊 Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Week 4)

### Add Advanced Endpoints
- [ ] /api/v1/inverter/metrics - Performance metrics
- [ ] /api/v1/inverter/logs - System logs with pagination
- [ ] /api/v1/inverter/diagnostics - Self-test results
- [ ] /api/v1/inverter/firmware - Version info and updates

### Implement Data Features
- [ ] Add query parameters for filtering data
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Add data export endpoints (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Create data aggregation endpoints (daily, weekly, monthly)

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 5)

### Create Test Suite
- [ ] Write unit tests for each endpoint
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Perform load testing

### API Testing Tools
- [ ] Set up Postman collection
- [ ] Create automated test scripts
- [ ] Test with different client scenarios
- [ ] Validate against API documentation

## 📚 Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment (Week 6)

### Complete Documentation
- [ ] Finalize OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- [ ] Create getting started guide
- [ ] Write code examples in multiple languages
- [ ] Document common use cases

### Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy

## 🚀 Phase 7: Launch & Monitoring

### Deploy New API
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Track API usage patterns
- [ ] Gather user feedback

### Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Set up error alerting
- [ ] Create backup procedures
- [ ] Plan for API versioning strategy
- [ ] Schedule regular security audits

## 📝 Quick Reference Checklist

### Essential REST Principles to Follow:
- Use nouns for resources, not verbs
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Version your API from the start
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Return JSON by default
- Include helpful error messages
- Document everything

### Avoid These Common Mistakes:
- Don't use GET for state-changing operations
- Don't expose internal implementation details
- Don't forget about rate limiting
- Don't ignore backwards compatibility
- Don't mix different concerns in one endpoint
